# VibeGame
A game created by vibe coding, there is no objective for the game. We will just see where this ends up over time.

# Rules
1. The majority of code is to be written by an AI
2. You can do minor code changes to optimise what the AI has produced.
   - Example 1: The AI was asked to refactor code into a class and dependency inject. It does but keep the old code as a fallback in a try catch. You can remove the catch (and old code), and just use the new class.
   - Example 2: The AI makes a class but doesnâ€™t use it. You can remove the class, or if you know where it should be implemented you are free to implement said class.
3. Code must be added as a pull request with a description of what was meant to achieve.
4. You can add assets and models to the project for the AI to use as the AI cannot generate its own assets.
    - NOTE: Assets must be compatible with the MIT licence.
    - Example: A model of a tree that the AI can use to display trees.
