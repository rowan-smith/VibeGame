| **aetherwild_grove**    | Mossy forest ground                     | Soft moss, leaf litter; likely ARM packed (AO/Rough/Metal)                                                |
| **bloodpetal_wilds**    | Red-flowered meadow soil                | Diffuse with scattered petals, rough/soft soil; ARM or separate AO + Rough                                |
| **echostep_marsh**      | Wet mud / marsh soil                    | Dark muddy soil with water reflections; ARM recommended, include displacement if swampy                   |
| **emberroot_basin**     | Charred soil / volcanic ash             | Dark, rough soil with embers; ARM or separate Rough/Metal if metallic ash present                         |
| **frostveil_tundra**    | Snowy frozen ground                     | White snow/ice, low roughness; normal map for ice patterns, ARM for AO/Rough                              |
| **glimmerfall_ridge**   | Rocky cliffside                         | Grey/brown rocks with highlights; ARM map preferred, maybe add displacement for ruggedness                |
| **mistral_dunes**       | Sand dunes                              | Fine sand; smooth roughness, ARM or separate Rough/AO, normal map for ripples                             |
| **nullscape**           | Lichen-covered rocks                    | Already set as litchen_rocks; ARM map recommended for AO/Rough/Metal                                      |
| **obsidian_expanse**    | Black volcanic glass                    | Smooth black shiny surface; ARM for AO/Rough/Metal, high spec/low roughness                               |
| **shatterglass_desert** | Cracked glassy desert                   | Highly reflective shards; ARM for AO/Rough/Metal, maybe a metallic channel                                |
| **solaris_steppe**      | Dry grassland soil                      | Tan soil with sparse grass; ARM packed map for AO/Rough/Metal, maybe displacement for small terrain bumps |
| **verdigris_expanse**   | Weathered copper / green oxidized metal | Green-blue patina on rocks; ARM preferred, metallic channel important                                     |
